about: |
  Currently a DevOps Engineer🚀 at Siemens, on my way to Cloud Solutions Architect⛅.<br>
  I find everything interesting, love problem solving and perform my best when in multi-disciplinary environments.<br>
  👉 I poke around systems. If they can be improved, they should be improved.<br>
  I care about [humane tech](https://www.humanetech.com/technologists) and [press freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press).<br>
